## General Information
- Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. 
- A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC).

## Conclusions
- From the M1 model history graphs we can clearly observe that our model is **over fitting** since as you increase the epoches we can see the training accuracy is increasing but validation accuracy is staying down.
- We can see in Model M2 we introducded augmented layer and Dropout layers and also we removed Overfitting because training and validation accuracy is nearly same across all the epoches but main problem is accuracy is not good , so we will now deal with one common problem named class imabalance.
- From the Model M3, Class rebalance helped so much that our accuracy is increased from 60 to 80 using the class rebalance technique . From above graph we can also observe that at 20 epoches our model is stabilized, beyong 20 epoches our model is overfitting.
